# Countdown Timer

## Overview
This Python project features a graphical user interface (GUI) countdown timer built using the `tkinter` library. The application allows users to start, pause, resume, and quit the countdown timer. It includes a visual progress bar and displays a custom message when the countdown ends. Additionally, a sound notification is played upon completion for Windows users.

## Features
- **Graphical Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface using `tkinter`.
- **Start, Pause, Resume, and Quit**: Controls to manage the countdown timer.
- **Custom End Message**: Option to set a custom message for when the countdown ends.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the remaining time.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays a sound upon completion (Windows only).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (standard in most Python installations)
- `winsound` module (for sound notifications on Windows)

## How to Run

**Interact with the GUI**:
    - Enter the countdown time in seconds in the text entry field.
    - Click "Start" to begin the countdown.
    - Use "Pause" to pause the countdown, "Resume" to continue, and "Quit" to exit the application.

## Example Usage
1. Open the application by running the script.
2. Enter a countdown time, e.g., `60` seconds.
3. Click "Start" to begin the countdown.
4. Click "Pause" to pause the countdown and "Resume" to continue.
5. The timer will display the remaining time and progress bar. When the countdown reaches zero, the end message will be displayed, and a sound will be played.

## Notes
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The sound notification feature is supported only on Windows. On other platforms, a notification message will be displayed instead.
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid input is provided (non-integer or negative number), an error message will be shown.
